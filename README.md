# Lab 6

## Assignment 1: Introduction to Exception Handling

Task: Write a simple C# program that includes a division operation. Intentionally introduce a divide-by-zero error and demonstrate how exception handling can be used to handle this specific exception.

Requirements:

Use a try-catch block to handle the divide-by-zero exception.
Display a meaningful error message when the exception occurs.
Include comments in your code explaining the purpose of the try, catch, and any other relevant sections.

## Assignment 2: Multiple Exceptions
Task: Modify the previous program to include multiple operations (arithmetic operations, file operations) within the try block. Introduce different types of exceptions and handle them appropriately.

Requirements:

Include at least 2 different types of exceptions.
Provide distinct error messages for each exception.
Use a combination of catch blocks to handle different exceptions.

## Assignment 3: Custom Exceptions
Task: Create a C# program that involves a user input. Implement a custom exception class to handle specific error conditions related to the input.

Requirements:

Define a custom exception class (e.g., InvalidInputException) that extends the Exception class.
Use the custom exception to handle specific input-related errors.
